                            	specialist, and program executive. After serving as the president of CEDU School, an adolescent treatment program, 
                            	Bill saw the need for therapeutic transportation services as a critical first step in a successful treatment process.

                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">“The physical journey to treatment is really a family’s first treatment 
                            		experience. If they have a negative first experience, their entire healing process is compromised. Our mission is 
                            		to provide a positive, therapeutic transportation experience for parents and children.”</p>
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">Since starting his therapeutic transportation business, his team has 
                            		provided safe transportation to thousands of teens and young adults, making Bill the most experienced therapeutic 
                            		transportation specialist in the United States. Bill is trusted and beloved by his colleagues in the therapeutic 
                            		professions and is affectionately known as “the teen whisperer” for his ability to connect with anxious or 
                            		resistant adolescent clients. Bill’s passion for this work comes from helping parents move from anxiety to hope. A 
                            		father and grandfather himself, he takes great satisfaction in helping other families thrive.</p>
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">When he’s not working with families, Bill listens to jazz, rock, and

                            	Associates was formed, Bob joined his brother as the companies vice president. Certified as a crisis prevention 
                            	intervention trainer by the Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI), Bob trains new staff, works directly with parents and

                            	people proactively, before they get involved with law enforcement,” says John. “It’s nice be a part of helping them

                            		enforcement taught him the critical skills of de‐escalation, safety management, risk assessment, and rapid rapport 
                            		building—even with resistant clients.</p>
<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">John’s greatest satisfaction in this work comes from helping parents 
                            		navigate this first difficult step of treatment and delivering the news that their child is safely in treatment. 
                            		“I love Bill Lane’s philosophy that ‘there are no bad kids’—even if they’re not making the best choices. We see

                            	parts of BL&A run smoothly. She also helps ensure that transportation costs for parents are kept at a minimum—part of

                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">Though Janet does not spend time with families, she is inspired in her 
                            		work by the company mission. “Bill, Bob, and John are really good at talking to people in crisis and making them 
                            		feel comfortable at a very difficult time in their lives. I hear Bob working with families and managing the team 
                            		every day. I see the grateful letters of reference from parents. It’s important work.”</p>
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">In addition to voracious reading and Sudoku puzzling, Janet loves 
                            		spending time with family and friends. “It makes no difference what we do,” she says, “whether it’s cooking, 
                            		sharing a meal, or just sitting on the beach listening to the waves, it’s great to be with the people I love.”

                            	<p class="margin-left-text">Carol’s involvement with young people began with the Assistance League of Redlands, a charitable organization that works with underprivileged youth where she managed public relations and treasurer duties.  After having two children of her own, she became active in the Redlands school system and community activities.  Because of her love of music, she joined a support group for the Redlands Bowl, an outdoor free concert venue, where she again handled PR and treasurer duties. <span class="janetmore" title="Read more about Janet Lane">Read more…</span></p>
                            	<div class="janettoggle" style="display: none;">
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">Carol joined Cedu School in 1992 as support for Bill in the transport division.  “This was a service that was fairly new to the industry, and many parents didn’t realize that we even existed.  I was glad we were able to help them.”  When BL&A became independent, Carol stayed on as treasurer.</p>
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">Carol’s energy for this work is fueled by the many letters and emails BL&A receives from grateful parents.  “Often they are shocked that the transport was such a success.  Bill has even been invited to attend a student’s graduation a full year or more following the transport.”  When she hears Bill, Bob or John talk with parents, she says,” They are so calming and reassuring that I know I would want someone like them in my life if I were in the same situation.”</p>
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">Soon after moving to California from her home state of Tennessee, Carol and Bill met on the beach of Santa Monica, and their love for beach life is still in existence today with their home in Mission Beach in San Diego.  When Carol is not handling BL&A duties, her favorite activity is spending time with her grandchildren “cooking, doing crafts, playing games, and encouraging their love of music.”<span class="janetless" title=""> Read less...</span></p>
