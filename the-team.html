                        <p>Our transportation professionals are recruited primarily from the mental health and/or law enforcement professions and are selected for their experience, therapeutic skill, and professional judgment. We conduct exhaustive background checks on all employees using regional, national, and governmental databases, including the California TrustLine Registry and Employee Investigative Services. Once selected, our therapeutic transportation professionals receive the following comprehensive training:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI) Training in Non‐Violent Crisis Intervention</li>
     						<li>First S.T.E.P. (Safe Therapeutic Escort Protocols) Training</li>
     						<li>First Aid Certification</li>
     						<li>CPR Certification</li>
     						<li>Ongoing on‐the‐job mentorship and training from senior team members</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="center-red">“I wanted to thank you and your team for your professional, calm, friendly manner. I think that really helped my daughter accept the news of treatment and your escort. It also made us feel much better about the whole process. We thought you were great!”<br />

                            	<p class="margin-left-text">Bill has been working with young people for almost four decades as a counselor, addictions specialist, and program executive. After serving as the president of CEDU School, an adolescent treatment program, Bill saw the need for therapeutic transportation services as a critical first step in a successful treatment process. <span class="billmore" title="Read more about Bill Lane">Read more…</span></p>

                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">“The physical journey to treatment is really a family’s first treatment experience. If they have a negative first experience, their entire healing process is compromised. Our mission is to provide a positive, therapeutic transportation experience for parents and children.”</p>
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">Since starting his therapeutic transportation business, his team has provided safe transportation to thousands of teens and young adults, making Bill the most experienced therapeutic transportation specialist in the United States. Bill is trusted and beloved by his colleagues in the therapeutic professions and is affectionately known as “the teen whisperer” for his ability to connect with anxious or resistant adolescent clients. Bill’s passion for this work comes from helping parents move from anxiety to hope. A father and grandfather himself, he takes great satisfaction in helping other families thrive.</p>
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">When he’s not working with families, Bill listens to jazz, rock, and blues and spends time at the beach with his beloved grandchildren—“the highlight of my entire life.” <span class="billless" title="">Read less...</span></p>

After having children of her own, Carol joined the PTA and became very active in the Redlands school system and community. She helped launch the Redlands Bowl Summer Music Festival—the oldest continuously running free concert program in the United States. <span class="carolmore" title="Read more about Carol Lane">Read more…</span></p>

                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">When Carol joined CEDU Family of Services in 1992, she quickly discovered that her strength was not family intervention. “I felt such compassion for these parents that we would just spend our calls crying together! So I decided to invest my passion for helping families in supporting the therapeutic process operationally.”</p>
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">Carol’s energy for this work is fueled by reading the many letters and emails BL&A receives from grateful parents. “Often they’re shocked that the transport went so well. Sometimes Bill and his team get invited to a kid’s graduation a full year or more after the transport took place—I think that is so cool!” When she hears Bill, Bob, and the team talking to parents, Carol says, “I know that would want someone like them in my life if I were in the same situation.”</p>
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">When Carol is not coordinating transportation details, she volunteers in her beloved San Diego and fiendishly completes crossword puzzles. But her favorite activity is spending time with her grandchildren “cooking, doing crafts, completing puzzles, or doing each other’s hair. <span class="carolless" title="">Read less...</span></p>

John’s work in law enforcement taught him the critical skills of de‐escalation, safety management, risk assessment, and rapid rapport building—even with resistant clients.</p>
                            		<p class="margin-left-text add-top-margin">John’s greatest satisfaction in this work comes from helping parents navigate this first difficult step of treatment and delivering the news that their child is safely in treatment. “I love Bill Lane’s philosophy that ‘there are no bad kids’—even if they’re not making the best choices.
